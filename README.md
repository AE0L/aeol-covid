# COVID-19 Tracker
Well there's nothing else to do in this quarantine  so I made a simple progressive web app that lets you save a list of countries and their latest COVID-19 pandemic statistics specifically the number of confirm cases, deaths, and successfully recovered COVID-19 patients.

## Installation
Go to the web apps heroku page right [here](https://aeol-covid.herokuapp.com). A pop-up will ask you to install the app on your homescreen just press install and your browser will guide you through it.

## Development
The app is originally made with plain vanilla JavaScript but I decided to learn TypeScript so I migrated the project into TypeScript. The code was not beautiful but I like the extra checkings I get from the typescript language server so it was worth the extra work.

## Plans
Well as of now, I'm not planning to add any new features to the app, I feel like its already complete and done its main job well.

## Contribution
I'll still check the app once in a while so you can contribute if you want or make an issue if you saw any bugs on the app.
